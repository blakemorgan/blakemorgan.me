Blake is a New York City-based singer, actor (AEA member), pianist,
percussionist, and music director. With a warm, grounded presence and a brainy,
versatile edge, Blake brings a unique blend of talents to the table—singing
tenor, acting, accompanying himself and others on piano, playing percussion,
and even music directing. Since moving to NYC in December and joining AEA, he's
hit the ground running: he's performed in a cabaret at Don’t Tell Mama, he is
scheduled to appear in another on May 4th, and he will be performing in and
music directing Dangerous and Dramatic at 54 Below on May 13th.

Currently, Blake is studying voice with Neil Semer and attending dance classes
at The Ailey School Extension and Steps On Broadway. Prior to his move, he
performed and played onstage at a regional theatre in Utah (Doug - _School of
Rock_, Band - _One for the Pot_), building a strong foundation in the art of
story telling through music and performance. He studied voice with Gary
Sorensen, studied percussion at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 2014, and has
played piano for nearly two decades. At BYU, he was in their Young Ambassadors,
Philharmonic Orchestra, Marching Band, and Steel Band ensembles. Outside of
college, he was drum major of the world-class Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps
in 2018.

Blake has performed in venues through the United States—including NFL stadiums,
Abravanel Hall and The Capitol Theatre in Utah, and the Hale Centre Theatre—and
China, and is a member of the Actors' Equity Association.
